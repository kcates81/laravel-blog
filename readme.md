##About This Site

This site is one of my last individual projects during my time at Codeup. I built this from scratch using the Laravel 4.2 framework. The basis for CSS styling on the site is Materialize CSS with custom CSS on top of it. I tried to use a variety of Materialize's features to familiarize myself with how to implement them on a working site. These features include responsive navigation bars, parallaxes, and sliders. I used MySQL (SequelPro) for all database functionality. I plan to continue to add and refine the functionality of this site as I learn more about Laravel and Materialize.
